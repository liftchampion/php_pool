<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector handles vectors in space.

An instance can be constructed from 'dest' Vertex:
new Vector( array('dest' => $dest ) );

Also you can specify 'orig' Vertex:
new Vector( array( 'orig' => $orig, 'dest' => $dest ) );

When not specified origin is considered to be (0,0,0).

Constructed vector is a vector from 'orig' to 'dest' with start moved to (0,0,0)

Origin and Destination must be instances of Vertex class.
Otherwise behavior is undefined.

Vector class has private x,y,z attributes. It considered to be constant so
you can only get its' value using getters.

The class provides the following methods :
float magnitude() : returns the vector’s length (or "norm").
Vector normalize() : returns a normalized version of the vector. If the vector is
already normalized, returns a fresh copy of the vector
Vector add( Vector $rhs ) : returns the sum vector of both vectors.
Vector sub( Vector $rhs ) : returns the difference vector of both vectors.
Vector opposite() : returns the opposite vector.
Vector scalarProduct( $k ) : returns the multiplication of the vector with a
scalar.
float dotProduct( Vector $rhs ) : returns the scalar multiplication of both vectors.
float cos( Vector $rhs ) : returns the angle’sAppendix cosine between both vectors.
Vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs ) : returns the cross multiplication of both
vectors (right-hand mark!)
